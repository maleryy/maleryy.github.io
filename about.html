        <p> Malery is foremost a papermaker but also an art conservator, home chef, gifter of small things. More recently she has been making lamps as an exercise in structural papermaking that explores the texture, flexibility, and strength of her handmade papers. Maleryâ€™s other work investigates Southeast Asian print history through the labor and craft of people who made books, prints, and paper with their hands. She seeks to challenge how artisans and craftspeople are defined by their labor capital through investigations of their individual creative authority in history. Likewise, she intends her work to speak for the integrity of its own making, from sourcing the fibers that make up the paper to the subtle placement of rice glue to hold everything together.
