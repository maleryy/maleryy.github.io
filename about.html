        <h1> says hi! </h1>

        <p> I am an aspiring art conservator, Southeast Asianist, papermaker, and bread baker.

            I am very interested in investigating history through the labor and creativity
            of people who made things with their hands. I seek to challenge how artisans
            and craftspeople are defined by their labor capital
            through investigations of their individual creative authority in history. <br> From the
            fibers that make up paper, to the mortar that upholds libraries, I'm especially curious
            about the study of Southeast Asian print history and its relevance in art historical,
            musuem, and academic spaces.
