        <h1> says hi! </h1>
        <p> I am a senior concentrating in history of art and architecture at Brown University,
            where my academic trials have taken me through poetry clouds, banana leaf stews,
            and mesa thunderstorms. This website is another one of my trials to experiment with
            coding to give a visible form to my creative work. </p>
        <p> I'm very interested in investigating history through the labor and creativity
            of people who made things with their hands. I seek to challenge how
             artisans and craftspeople are defined by the outputs of their work
            rather than their individual creative labor. Most recently, I've investigated the agency
            of a <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Diary_of_a_Manchu_Soldier_in_Sevente/8piRAgAAQBAJ?hl=en">
            Manchu soldier's diary in seventeenth-century China</a> and tried to unpack the process of
            Southeast Asian papermaking to define my own creative medium of intellectual pursuit.</p>
