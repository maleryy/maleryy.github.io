      <p>This 8-foot accordion book was the outcome of an activity that I led calling on my peers to engage with one another and share
        a personal story. We took on the collaborative effort with a readiness and appreciation for the necessary and
        relevant practices that had already built up our "Ethnic Studies & Education" class community throughout
        the semester. By exercising a culturally responsive pedagogy, our class also developed a sense of trust in
        one another as a community with the ability to affirm our identities and selfhoods. The work brings into
        question what forms collective narratives could take and the capacity of our class to
        reconcile our shared experiences as learners with our other lives outside of the classroom. </p>
