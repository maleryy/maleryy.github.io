      <p>unpacking memory and heritage through family photos</p>

      <p>The drawing and collage depicts my grandparents’ old house in Saigon, Vietnam,
        which they maintained during the war and where generations of our heritage resided.
        The project explores the manifestation of memory through time as an architectural
        form influenced by personal, political, and natural history. I developed the spatial
        landscape of the drawing from childhood memories, conversations with relatives, and
        family photographs. The collaged textures were gathered from sources of my family’s
        recorded past, photographs of my parent’s home wedding ceremony.</p>
      <p>The personal undertones challenge where my fragmented sense of identity belongs among
        or beside an artifact of my family and heritage.</p>
